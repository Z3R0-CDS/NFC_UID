# NFC_UID
Get the UID of an NFC chip/Card

## Purp
I had a few issues getting a good software or tutorial for this so... I made it.
Anyways have fun with it and if you copy it I would be happy to get a mention ^^.

## Modules / Installation 
 smartcard is NOT a module it self / well it is you can kinda install it but I could not use it!
 So use pip install pyscard  instead!
 Asides that just pip install keyboard and you are ready to go.
