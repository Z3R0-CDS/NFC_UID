# NFC_UID
Get the UID of an NFC chip/Card

## Purp
    I had a few issues getting a good software or tutorial for this so... I made it.
    Anyways have fun with it and if you copy it I would be happy to get a mention ^^.
    
    Console usage will be added soon with 0.4

## Modules / Installation 
    smartcard is NOT a module it self / well it is you can kinda install it but I could not use it!
    So use pip install pyscard  instead!
    Asides that just run following code and you are ready to go:
```
pip install keyboard
```
